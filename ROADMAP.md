# Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features, improvements, and technical debt items for the project. Items are organized by priority and implementation timeline.

## Architecture Overview

🏗️ **Configuration-Driven Feature System**

This project uses a **JSON-driven architecture** that allows features to be defined declaratively and automatically generated:

- **Feature Configuration** (`src/config/features.json`): Define features, endpoints, UI elements, and data types in JSON
- **Automatic UI Generation**: Navigation items and components are generated by looping over the configuration
- **Reusable Components**: Shared components (`DataGrid`, `FormDialog`, `ConfirmDialog`) are used across all features
- **Easy Feature Management**: Enable/disable features by changing a single flag in the JSON
- **Type-Safe**: TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety across the configuration

**Benefits:**
- Add new features by updating JSON configuration
- Consistent UI patterns across all features
- Reduced code duplication
- Easy maintenance and scalability
- Feature flags for controlled rollouts

See `src/config/features.json` for the complete feature configuration.
